# Java Project: Hyundai Test Drive Booking System

## A. Story

* Hyundai car dealer wants to streamline its test drive booking process.
* They need a simple web application that allows them to easily book test drives for their customers' desired car models.

## B. Core Features

* Store basic information about each car model (brand, model, year, image).

### Test Drive Booking

* Allow the dealership to select a car model, preferred date, and time slot for the test drive for the customer.
* Display available time slots based on the selected car model and date.
* Capture customer information (name, email, phone number).
* Validate input to ensure all required fields are filled and the email format is correct.
* Store booking information in the database.

## C. Technical Requirements

### Backend

* Use Java Programming Language (minimum version Java 11)
* Use Spring Boot to build the backend REST API.
* Use JPA for database interaction (you can use an in-memory database like H2 for simplicity).
* Implement basic input validation using Spring Boot Validation.
* Write unit tests for core functionalities (e.g., booking creation, validation).
* Using Git for source code versioning
* Authentication & Authorization process is not required for this stage
